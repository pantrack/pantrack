			<h1>PanTrack Neuroimaging</h1>
			<p><strong>PanTrack</strong> is a unix&#x2011;friendly, deterministic tractography software suite 	   with command&#x2011;line tools for processing, post&#x2011;processing, and manipulating
			   diffusion&#x2011;weighted imaging (DWI) data.  Pantrack can be used to generate robust,
			   direct structural connectivity networks from white matter fiber estimations both
			   between and within brain structures, which allows for in vivo evaluation of intra&#x2011;structural
			   white matter topography in addition to refinement of traditional structural connectivity analyses.</p>
			<p>PanTrack is presently compatible with TrackVis’ format tractography files (i.e. “.trk”)
			   and NIFTI files (i.e. “.nii” and “.nii.gz”), which can be viewed using any GUI
			   which supports these filetypes (e.g. AFNI, FSL, TrackVis, etc.).</p>
			<p><strong>Code development and optimization is currently in progress.
			   PanTrack will eventually be released for research use in
			   English and Spanish, after further optimization to ensure
			   cross&#x2011;compatibility and a user&#x2011;friendly experience.</strong></p>
			<p class="small-font">PanTrack’s release date is undetermined at this time, as development is independent from the
			   developers’ funded research projects.  All downloads, documentation, and other
			   pertinent information will be published at this location when available.</p>
			<p><strong>If you would like to be informed when the first public release becomes available for 	   download, please follow us on Social Media (links below) or <a href="mailto:pantrack.help@gmail.com">email us directly at pantrack.help@gmail.com.</a>
			   Those who request to be contacted by email may be offered early access.</strong></p>
